# BEM_PINN_LSTM-Fault-Diagnosis-System-for-Wind-Turbines
> An AI-argumented paradigm for safety operation of wind power systems

This repository provides a physics–data hybrid framework for real-time load prediction and fault detection in wind turbines, combining **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models.

The proposed method uses a PINN-based Blade Element Momentum (BEM) model to estimate physically consistent aerodynamic loads, while an LSTM model learns the temporal evolution of normal operating conditions and performs one-step-ahead load prediction. Abnormal turbine dynamics are identified by monitoring the residuals between LSTM predictions and PINN estimations.

The technical details is in the filefolder `Models/`.

## 🔧 Main Components

1. `BEM_PINN.py`
- Implements a Physics-Informed Neural Network to estimate inflow angles and aerodynamic loads.
- Enforces physical constraints derived from BEM theory.
- Outputs thrust and torque used as physically consistent reference signals.

2. `BEM_LSTM.py`
- Implements a purely data-driven LSTM model.
- Trained using load sequences generated by the PINN under normal operating conditions.
- Predicts one-step-ahead thrust and torque based on historical load data.

3. `BEM_FaultDiagnosis.py`
- Simulates abnormal turbine dynamics by injecting artificial faults into rotor speed (`Ω`).
- Compares LSTM predictions with PINN-based load estimations.
- Detects anomalies using time-aligned relative residuals of thrust and torque.

## 📊 Data Description

- The folder `DATA2/` contains simulated wind turbine operational data, including wind speed, rotor speed, and pitch angle.

- All trained models is placed in `Models/`.

- This dataset is derived from the simulation data provided in the 2024 Huawei Cup Mathematical Modeling Competition and is used solely for academic research and methodological validation.

- All fault scenarios in this repository are artificially generated and do not represent real turbine failures.

## 🚀 Typical Workflow

1. Load SCADA-like data using `freedom.py`
2. Use `BEM_PINN.py` to surrogate the BEM (Blade Element Momentum) computation;
3. Train an LSTM model in `BEM_LSTM.py` to esitmate load sequence according to the load history;
4. Perform fault injection and detection using `BEM_FaultDiagnosis.py` by comparing the PINN and LSTM results;
5. Visualize load trajectories and residual-based fault indicators.

## 📌 Notes

- The output of PINN model with hard constraints can accurately surrogate BEM operator with extremely few training data (e.g. 10s).

- The LSTM model is trained using historical sequences (e.g., 50 s).

- The PINN and LSTM outputs are time-aligned carefully to ensure physically meaningful residual computation.
